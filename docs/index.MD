* Design parameters to meet design intent for each map.

## Intro to the problem
Manually created maps are limited to our budget (both in time and money). We can create awesome levels but they consume a lot of production resources.   

What if we could create a different map in each game? What if we could have endless different combinations?
Well, we can do it with procedural map generation.
Let's see...

### When is it useful to use procedural methodologies instead of doing maps manually?
Well, certainly we should use different methodologies depending on the project requirements.

* Manual
  * If it's a small game.
  * It needs to follow a defined story/narrative.
  * You need extreme details.
* Procedural
  * It's an open-world game.
  * You want endless different map combinations.
  * You want every game to be unique.
