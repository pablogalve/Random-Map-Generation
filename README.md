# Random Map Generation
 
I am [Pablo Galve](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablogalve), student of the
[Bachelor’s Degree in
Video Games Programming and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/) by UPC at CITM). 
This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer
[Marc Garrigó](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo).

# Tutorial
You can find the tutorial on how to use that on my website: https://pablogalve.github.io/Random-Map-Generation/
You'll find:
- Different algorithms
- Perlin Noise Explanation/Implementation in Depth (Perfect for creating procedural outdoor maps!)
- Homework with solutions to learn better how it works.
- Possible implementations to make it even more awesome.
	- Infinite maps
	- UI to adjust procedural parameters easily

# Controls 
- Arrow Keys: Move around map
- Space: Generate a new random map
- F1: Generates default map (Seed 1337)
